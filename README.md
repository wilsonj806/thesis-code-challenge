# Thesis Code Challenge(Wilson Jiang)
## Overview
This repo contains a link to the Thesis code challenge. Static assets are in the `assets` folder and contain fonts or images exported from the Figma mockup provided.

## Design RFC
- Give form a solid background
  - better for people with bad vision
- Add slightly more content/ images or change current content to  better describe Stamp
  - For SEO and images to break up the flow of the page
  - it's also a bit too clean/ sterile looking because of the lack of content and the plain colors
- Move nav bar links(About, integrations, etc) so they're on the right with the hamburger on desktop
  - better UX as all navigation links are grouped together rather than having some being in the center and some being hidden by the menu
- Add "Menu" text to the hamburger on desktop(and maybe mobile) for accessibility
- Logo's kind of generic, but slightly unrelated to the general design of the page
- Footer isn't really distinct from the rest of the page's content, it blends into the rest of the page rather than indicates that it's the end of content

## FIXME
Things I don't have time for:
- burger menu doesn't span entire width of the screen on mobile even though it should
- password visibility button
