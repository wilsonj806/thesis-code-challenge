# Thesis Code Challenge
## Design RFC
- Give form a solid background
  - better for people with bad vision and still works fine with the form
- Add slightly more content or change current content to  better describe Stamp
  - for SEO
- Move nav bar links(About, integrations, etc) so they're on the right with the hamburger on desktop
  - better UX as all navigation links are grouped together rather than having some being in the center and some being hidden by the menu
