# Thesis Code Challenge
## Overview
This repo contains a link to the Thesis code challenge. Static assets are in the `assets` folder and contain fonts or images exported from the Figma mockup provided.

## Design RFC
- Give form a solid background
  - better for people with bad vision and still works fine with the form
- Add slightly more content or change current content to  better describe Stamp
  - for SEO
- Move nav bar links(About, integrations, etc) so they're on the right with the hamburger on desktop
  - better UX as all navigation links are grouped together rather than having some being in the center and some being hidden by the menu
- Add "Menu" text to the hamburger on desktop(and maybe mobile) for accessibility

## FIXME
Includes things I don't have time for:
- burger menu doesn't span entire width of the screen on mobile even though it should
